**Gruntfile examples**

1. Chose the Gruntfile and package that you need for your project.
2. Copy folder with those files to `[project_folder]/grunt/`.  
	You should have something like: `/mysite/grunt/lessjs/`  
	If you need _grunticon_ on your project, copy grunticon  
	folder to `[project_folder]/grunt/`, so that you have i.e.  
	`/mysite/grunt/grunticon/`.
3. Run `npm install` in the folder where Gruntfile.js and package.json are.

**== IMPORTANT ==**  
Do not place Gruntfile.js and package.json  
in `/mysite/`, but in subfolder `grunt/something/`
